# Pneumonia Detection Web App

This **Pneumonia Detection Web App** is a healthcare-focused application designed to assist in early pneumonia diagnosis by classifying chest X-rays as "Pneumonia" or "Normal." Developed with a custom CNN model and built on Streamlit, the app provides healthcare professionals with efficient, real-time analysis and clear classification results.

## Key Features

- **High-Accuracy Classification**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras achieves 92% accuracy in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images, aiding early diagnosis.

- **Streamlit Deployment**: The web app interface, created with Streamlit, allows users to upload and analyze X-ray images with ease.

- **Real-Time Image Processing**: Integrated with OpenCV, the app provides immediate processing and classification of uploaded images.

- **Seamless Image Handling**: Uses Pillow for smooth image uploads and conversions, ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow
- **Language**: Python

This project demonstrates expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and real-time deployment, showcasing practical applications of AI in healthcare.
